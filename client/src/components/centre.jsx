            Catalyst was launched in 2016 by IIT Mandi as Himachal Pradesh’s
            first Technology Business Incubator (TBI). Strongly backed by the
            Central Government and State Government, Catalyst strives to
            incubate technology-based start-ups focused on economic and/or
            social impacts. As the name implies, it serves as a 'catalyst' to
            nurture and guide entrepreneurial initiatives with social and/or
            commercial objectives.

            The majority of the research in the BioX area is being carried out
            as a part of the BioX Centre, which was conceived at IIT Mandi in
            2012, driven by the need for affordable health care for India, and
            advanced technology interventions in agriculture and for
            preservation of the environment in the Himalayan Region. Since then,
            IIT Mandi started to hire faculty and made an initial investment of
            Rs. 10 crores in lab equipment. As it had reached a critical mass,
            the formal structure of the BioX Centre was approved in December
            2016. The BioX Centre building was inaugurated on May 13, 2017, by
            Professor K. Vijay Raghavan, Secretary, Dept. of Biotechnology,
            Govt. of India in the presence of Professor Sarit Kumar Das,
            Director IIT Ropar, and Professor Timothy A Gonsalves, Director IIT
            Mandi.
